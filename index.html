            <h1>My Dearest Sukhreet ❤️</h1>
            <p> 
Life works in mysterious ways. One random day, in a group full of strangers, I stumbled upon you, Sukhhieeeee. 
                And just like that, the ordinary turned extraordinary. You weren’t just another name on my screen—you became the melody my heart sings to. 
                I don’t know if fate exists, but if it does, it surely led me to you. And for that, I am endlessly grateful.

            <h1>You Are My Music 🎶</h1>
            <p>
              I play the guitar, but without you, my melodies feel incomplete. If life were a song, I’d want you to be my music—the rhythm to my soul, 
                the harmony to my chaos, the tune that never fades. Because every note, every chord, every lyric would mean nothing without you in it, sometimes mai sochta,
              ki aap samne baithe ve ho nd mai guitar bajara hu nd dono gana gare ho ...just imagine hulululuulu...

            <p>
                Sukhreet, I’m not here for something temporary. I want to date you for marriage. I want to build a future where 
                every day starts and ends with you. If you’re comfortable, let’s take this journey together. Let’s create something so beautiful that 
                even time will envy us. Let’s grow old side by side, hand in hand, heart in heart.
            </p>

            <p>
                  You look adorable—both with and without your glasses. You love makeup but find it difficult, and I want you to know that if I’m here, 
                you’ll never have to worry. You’re a foodie, and lucky for you—i know how to cook !!!smjh re ho na mtlb nahi toh batau mai ...vaise hushiyar to ho aap. 
              Imagine this: you, me, our favorite food "jo maine banay hoga", endless conversations, uno cards , one room with dim lights, ek bohot bada sa tv , ek blanket,
              apki favorite movie "mere hisab se toh '50 shades of grey best rhegi baki apki ikcha anusar'"
